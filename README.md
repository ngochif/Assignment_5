Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to use Hierarchical Clustering

Directions

The dataset Cereals.csv includes nutritional information, store display, and consumer ratings for
77 breakfast cereals.

Data Preprocessing. Remove all cereals with missing values.

● Apply hierarchical clustering to the data using Euclidean distance to the normalized
measurements. Use Agnes to compare the clustering from single linkage, complete
linkage, average linkage, and Ward. Choose the best method.

● How many clusters would you choose?

● Comment on the structure of the clusters and on their stability. Hint: To check stability,
partition the data and see how well clusters formed based on one part apply to the other
part.

● The elementary public schools would like to choose a set of cereals to include in their
daily cafeterias. Every day a different cereal is offered, but all cereals should support a
healthy diet. For this goal, you are requested to find a cluster of “healthy cereals.”
Should the data be normalized? If not, how should they be used in the cluster analysis?
